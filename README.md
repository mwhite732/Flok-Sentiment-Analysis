# Flok-Sentiment-Analysis

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook file I used in performing sentiment analysis of the Flok app.

The dataset used in my analysis came directly from the creators of the app with their permission. For more information on this app, visit flokapp.io.

I am in no way affiliated with the Flok app. This project was done entirely for educational purposes.
